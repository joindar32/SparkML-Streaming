# SparkML-Streaming
This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a machine learning model using Apache Spark with real-time data streaming.

## Project Structure

- **`train_and_evaluate.ipynb`**: Data loading, preprocessing, and model training and evaluation.
- **`console_app.ipynb`**: Application of the trained model to new input data.
- **`streaming_app.ipynb`**: Application of the trained model on streaming data.
